These insurance plans are characterized by higher deductibles and lower premiums. For 2021, the IRS defines a high-deductible health plan as one that has deductibles of at least $1,400 for an individual or $2,800 for a family. Total out-of-pocket maximums are $7,000 for an individual and $14,000 for a family.3\r\n\r\nFor 2022, the deductible limits will remain the same. But the out-of-pocket maximums will increase to $7,050 and $14,100, respectively.3 Out-of-pocket maximums don''t apply to out-of-network services.\r\n\r\nHigh-deductible health plans offer a unique advantage in that if you have one, you''re permitted to open—and contribute pretax income to—a health savings account, which can be used to pay for qualified medical expenses. These plans offer a triple tax benefit in that:\r\n\r\nContributions are tax-deductible.\r\nContributions grow on a tax-deferred basis.\r\nQualified withdrawals for healthcare expenses are tax-free.4\r\nIn addition to health insurance, ill people who qualify can get help from a number of auxiliary products available on the market. These include disability insurance, critical (catastrophic) illness insurance, and long-term care (LTC) insurance.\r\n\r\nNote\r\nYou can withdraw money from an HSA after age 65 for any reason with no penalty, though you will pay income tax on the withdrawal if the money is not used for qualified medical expenses.\r\n\r\nSpecial Considerations\r\nIn 2010, President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act (ACA) into law. In participating states, the act expanded Medicaid, a government program that provides medical care for individuals with very low incomes. In addition to these changes, the ACA established the federal Health Insurance Marketplace.5 It also prohibited insurance companies from denying coverage to patients with preexisting conditions and allowed children to remain on their parents'' insurance plan until they reach the age of 26.6\r\n\r\nThe Marketplace helps individuals and businesses shop for quality insurance plans at affordable rates. Insurance available through the ACA Marketplace is mandated by the law to cover 10 essential health benefits. Through the HealthCare.gov website, shoppers can find the Marketplace in their state.\r\n\r\n Eligible insured may qualify for a premium tax credit to help offset the cost of health insurance purchased through the federal marketplace.\r\nChanges in the Affordable Care Act\r\nUnder the ACA, Americans were required to carry medical insurance that meets federally designated minimum standards or face a tax penalty, but Congress removed that penalty in December 2017.7 A Supreme Court ruling in 2012 struck down an ACA provision that required states to expand Medicaid eligibility as a condition for receiving federal Medicaid funding, and a number of states chose to refuse expansion.8 As of 2021, an estimated 31 million people have health coverage through the Affordable Care Act.9\r\n\r\nMedicare and CHIP\r\nTwo public health insurance plans, Medicare and the Children''s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), target older individuals and children (respectively) who need help with health insurance. Medicare, which is available to those age 65 or older, also serves people with certain disabilities. The CHIP plan has income limits and covers babies and children up to the age of 18.10\r\n\r\n Though Medicaid can help older seniors to pay for long-term care in a nursing home, Medicare does not.\r\nWhat Is Health Insurance and Why Do You Need It?\r\nHealth insurance is an agreement you make with an insurer to have them pay for some or all of your medical expenses in exchange for a premium. Having health insurance can keep you from incurring medical bills you can''t afford to pay out of pocket.\r\n\r\nWho Needs Health Insurance?\r\nThe simple answer is everyone. Health insurance can help to offset the costs of minor medical issues or major ones, including surgeries or treatment for life-threatening illnesses. But if you don''t have health insurance, you won''t be penalized for it under the terms of the Affordable Care Act.\r\n\r\nHow Do You Get Health Insurance?\r\nIf your employer offers health insurance as part of an employee benefits package, you may be covered by it. You can also purchase health insurance through the Health Insurance Marketplace. Certain individuals may qualify for health insurance coverage through Medicaid or Medicare programs.\r\n\r\nHow Much Does Health Insurance Cost?\r\nYour costs for health insurance can vary based on the scope of coverage, the type of plan you have, and your deductibles. Copays and coinsurance can also add to the cost, so it''s important to consider what you''ll pay before enrolling in a healthcare plan.',

Instead, choose a disability policy that provides enough coverage to enable you to enjoy your current lifestyle even if you can no longer continue working. \r\n\r\nLong-term disability provides a monetary benefit equal to a portion (e.g., 50% or 60%) of the insured''s salary for covered disabilities. Long-term disability typically begins when short-term disability ends. To receive benefits, the disability must have occurred after the policy''s issuance and then, typically after a waiting period. Medical information, often confirmed by a physician, must be provided to the insurer for consideration.\r\n\r\nMost long-term disability insurance policies categorize disabilities as own occupation or any occupation.1 Own occupation means the insured, due to disability, is unable to perform their regular job or a similar job. Any occupation means the insured, due to disability, is unable to perform any job for which they are qualified.\r\n\r\nSimilar to short and long-term disability insurance, workers'' compensation, or workers'' comp, it pays a monetary benefit to workers who become injured or disabled at work or while performing their jobs. Most states require employers to carry workers'' compensation insurance for their employees.
